What does Audiere mean?
--

It's Latin for 'to hear'.  Pronounced oww dee err ayy.
Rizen suggested it (and he's to blame for any
incorrect information).  :)


Why did you make this?  We already have FMOD.
--

I'm not a fan of FMOD's API, and it's not open source.
It's a lot of fun, too.  :)


Why not support MIDI?
--

I'd like to keep every supported decoder inside of Acoustique (i.e. not using
an external program).  The only good software MIDI decoder I've found is
timidity++, and that requires megs upon megs of patch files.  I think having
a 20 meg sound library isn't really feasible.
