Work Left To Be Done:

Linux port
MacOS port
support 3D audio (OpenAL?  DirectSound3D?  Both?)
.NET bindings
Scheme bindings
seekable streams
streaming over a network
integrate with a sane build system (maybe autoconf/automake?)
do a thread-safety audit
make the null output driver actually read samples with correct timing
