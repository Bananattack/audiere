At the moment, I'm required to release Audiere under the GPL, as it uses Acoustique,
which uses MAD, which is licensed under the GPL.  The rest of the code is either
mine or is public domain, so at some point in the future, I may make a version
without MP3 support (or using another MP3 decoder) under the LGPL or BSD licenses.

We'll see.  Get ahold of me (aegis@aegisknight.org) if you have questions.
