Audiere is a convenient, high-level audio API that handles file I/O, decoding,
mixing, and sound output for you.  See tutorial.txt on how to get started using
it.  See architecture.txt or the source code if you're curious how it works.

I created Audiere for use in the Sphere RPG Engine and the Naikai Game Engine.

Audiere is licensed under the GPL and the LGPL.  See legal-issues.txt.
