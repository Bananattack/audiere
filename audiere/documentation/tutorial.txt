This a very simple introduction to a very simple API.

First, #include <audiere.h>

(make sure the Audiere header is in your compiler include path somewhere)

You need an Audiere context before you can play sounds...


ADR_CONTEXT context = AdrCreateContext(NULL);
if (!context) {
  // failure
} 


Now that we have a context, we can actually open and play songs.


ADR_STREAM stream = AdrOpenStream(context, "American Jesus.mp3");
if (!stream) {
  // failure
}

AdrPlayStream(stream);

bool done = false;
while (!done) {
  // do something until the user wants to quit
}


Okay, now that we're done, destroy the stream and then destroy the context.
You can even destroy the context before you close the stream!


AdrCloseStream(stream);
AdrDestroyContext(context);


That's it!  Look in audiere.h for descriptions of the remaining functions.
