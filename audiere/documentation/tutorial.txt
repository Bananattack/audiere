This a very simple introduction to a very simple API.

First, #include <audiere.h>

(make sure the Audiere header is in your compiler include path somewhere)

You need an Audiere context before you can play sounds...


ADR_CONTEXT context = AdrCreateContext(
  "autodetect",  // just give me an output device
  "",            // no extra parameters
  NULL,          //
  NULL,          // If we pass in NULL for the file I/O callbacks, Audiere
  NULL,          // uses the standard C runtime functions.
  NULL,          //
  NULL,          //
  NULL           //
);
if (!context) {
  // failure
} 


Now that we have a context, we can actually open and play songs.


ADR_STREAM stream = AdrOpenStream(context, "American Jesus.mp3");
if (!stream) {
  // failure
}

AdrPlayStream(stream);

bool done = false;
while (!done) {
  // do something until the user wants to quit
}


Okay, now that we're done, destroy the stream and then destroy the context.
Remember, all streams must be closed before the context is destroyed.


AdrCloseStream(stream);
AdrDestroyContext(context);


That's it!  Look in audiere.h for descriptions of the remaining functions.
