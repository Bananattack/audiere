This document gives a general overview of how Audiere works.

Audiere provides two types of objects: contexts and streams.  A context represents
a filesystem (a way of opening file objects) and an output device (a mechanism for
mixing streams of PCM data and pumping them to the sound card).  Every context also
has its own thread associated with it.  The thread's job is to periodically ask
the output driver to output itself.  If the output driver needs more samples, it
asks Audiere to provide them, who in term asks Acoustique to decode more samples
from the file.

Internally, there are several types of output devices.  Currently (as of 1.0.4) it
supports DirectSound 8, DirectSound 3, null output.


Here's a nifty drawing:
