Audiere Bindings for Python

Introduction
--
In my quest to get Audiere used everywhere, I made Python bindings for it
(admittedly mostly for the v27 community).


How do I install it?
--

Into ActiveState's Python 2.1:
  Copy the pyAudio.pyd into Python21/DLLs.

Into v27:
  Just copy pyAudio.pyd into your VERGE folder.


How do I use it?
--

import audiere                                   # brings in the Audiere module
context = audiere.open_context("autodetect", "") # creates an Audiere context object
song = context.open_stream("song.mp3")           # opens a song
song.play()                                      # begins playback


Cool!  What else can I do?
--

All you can do with contexts are open streams...

The interesting stuff is in the stream objects:

song.play()  # begins playback
song.reset() # resets a song from the beginning
song.pause() # stops playback, but does not reset from the beginning

song.volume = integer # volume can be 0 (quiet) up to 255 (loudest)
                      # defaults to 255

song.repeating = true|false # sets whether the song should repeat or not

song.playing # (read-only) true if song is playing, false otherwise
