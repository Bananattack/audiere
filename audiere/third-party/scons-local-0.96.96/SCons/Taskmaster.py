Generic Taskmaster module for the SCons build engine.

This module contains the primary interface(s) between a wrapping user
interface and the SCons build engine.  There are two key classes here:

    Taskmaster
        This is the main engine for walking the dependency graph and
        calling things to decide what does or doesn't need to be built.

    Task
        This is the base class for allowing a wrapping interface to
        decide what does or doesn't actually need to be done.  The
        intention is for a wrapping interface to subclass this as
        appropriate for different types of behavior it may need.

        The canonical example is the SCons native Python interface,
        which has Task subclasses that handle its specific behavior,
        like printing "`foo' is up to date" when a top-level target
        doesn't need to be built, and handling the -c option by removing
        targets as its "build" action.  There is also a separate subclass
        for suppressing this output when the -q option is used.

        The Taskmaster instantiates a Task object for each (set of)
        target(s) that it decides need to be evaluated and/or built.
