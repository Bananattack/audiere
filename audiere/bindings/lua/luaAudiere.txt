Audiere Bindings for Lua

How do I install it?
--

This module requires Lua 5.1.  So far, it has only been integrated into
the VC6 build system on Windows.  Once luaAudiere.dll is built, put it
somewhere in your PATH or in the same directory as the Lua executable.
Then put the audiere.lua stub in the standard location for Lua modules
in your configuration.  Due to Lua's configurability, details will vary.


How do I use it?
--

-- bring in the Audiere module
require "audiere"
-- print the version information
print(audiere.GetVersion())
-- open the default AudioDevice
device = audiere.OpenDevice()
-- open a song in streaming mode
song = audiere.OpenSound(device, "song.ogg", true)
-- begin playback
song:play()

For a more complex example, take a look at demo.lua.


Cool!  What else can I do?

The audiere module exposes the following functions from the C++ API:

  - GetVersion
  - GetSupportedFileFormats
  - GetSupportedAudioDevices
  - GetSampleSize
  - OpenDevice (including both optional arguments)
  - OpenSampleSource (all available signatures)
  - CreateTone
  - CreateSquareWave
  - CreateWhiteNoise
  - CreatePinkNoise
  - CreateLoopPointSource (all available signatures)
  - OpenSound (all available signatures)
  - CreateMemoryFile (pass in arbitrary data as a string)

The OutputStream and LoopPointSource interfaces are completely exposed.
The SampleSource interface is exposed except for the read method.
The update, openStream, and getName methods of the AudioDevice interface
are exposed.  File objects can be passed between C++ and Lua, but none
of the File methods are avilable from Lua.

It's possible for other C++ code, such as other C++ extension modules
or the host application, to pass objects implementing any of the
above interfaces to Lua, so Lua code can pass them on to Audiere.
To see how these objects are passed between Lua and C++, refer to the
luaAudiereTypes.h header file.
