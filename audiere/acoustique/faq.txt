Why not support MIDI?
--

I'd like to keep every supported decoder inside of Acoustique (i.e. not using
an external program).  The only good software MIDI decoder I've found is
timidity++, and that requires megs upon megs of patch files.  I think having
a 20 meg sound library isn't really feasible.
