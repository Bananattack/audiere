Overview of the Audiere API

Everything is in the audiere namespace.  After #including <audiere.h>,
you can enter the line "using namespace audiere;" or explicitly
qualify the API symbols, i.e. "audiere::GetVersion();".

Every Audiere class has an associated refcounted smart pointer type.
For example, class File has a FilePtr type which manages the number of
references on the File objects.  (For the curious, FilePtr is a
typedef to RefPtr<File>.)  Remember!!  FilePtr is NOT the same as
File*.  File* does not automatically manage references, and is
therefore unsafe.  If you don't understand the difference, just use
FilePtr.
