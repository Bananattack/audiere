What does Audiere mean?
--

  It's just a cool word.  :)  Pronounced "awww dee air".


I got Audiere to compile and install properly, but when I try to link
with it, I get an error telling me that "libaudiere cannot be found"
What do I do?
--

  Locate the libaudiere libraries on your system.  By default, they're
  in /usr/local/lib.  Make sure that directory is listed in
  /etc/ld.so.conf or add the path to the environmental variable
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  If you changed /etc/ld.so.conf, run ldconfig as
  root.  It should work now.


Why did you make this?  We already have FMOD.

  I'm not a fan of FMOD's API, and it's not open source.  It's a lot
  of fun, too.  :)


Why not support MIDI?
--

  I'd like to keep every supported decoder inside of Acoustique
  (i.e. not using an external program).  The only good software MIDI
  decoder I've found is timidity++, and that requires megs upon megs
  of patch files.  I think having a 20 meg sound library isn't really
  feasible.
