Audiere depends on libogg, libvorbis, and libvorbisfile in UNIX.  In
Windows, those sources are included within the source tree.  Those
libraries are available at http://www.vorbis.com/

wxPlayer depends on wxWindows 2.2.9.  The VC7 build crashes, however.
See wxPlayer.cpp for more details.  Get wxWindows at
http://www.wxwindows.org/
