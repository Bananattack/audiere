Device Parameters

Each device in Audiere supports a set of parameters that are used to
customize the device's behavior or performance.  If a device
encounters parameters it does not understand, it ignores them.

This document describes parameters available for each device.

The DirectSound device ("directsound", default on Windows) supports
the following parameters:

device_guid (string) : The GUID representing the device DirectSound
                       should use.  The user of Audiere is responsible
                       for implementing device enumeration and
                       selection.  The string should be in the format
                       returned by UuidToString.  If not specified,
                       DirectSound uses the default device.

buffer (int) : The length of the audio buffer in milliseconds.  A
               shorter buffer means lower latency, but could skip more
               often and suffer reduced performance.  The default is
               one second.

global (boolean) : This device sets the DSBCAP_GLOBALFOCUS bit on all
                   of its streams.  This means the application's
                   sounds can be heard even when the application loses
                   focus.  If set to false, the application's sounds
                   can only be heard when it has focus.  The default
                   is true.

The OSS device ("oss", default on Linux) supports the following
parameters:

device (string) : The file device Audiere should write to.  The
                  default is "/dev/dsp".
