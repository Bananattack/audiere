  SGI AL output support
  support for big-endian architectures

2002.08.18

    wxWindows is installed

2002.08.17

  created a WinMM audio device
  refcounted the Audiere interfaces/objects
  fixed bug on Linux where the more streams were playing, the lower

    in mikmod)

  added stereo panning support again

2002.08.01

  completely new API, with AudioDevice, OutputStream, SampleSource, File,
    Sound...
